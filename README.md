Sprite packer for Unity

Work like using Texture Packer with Unity. Pack the sprites with SpriteSheetPacker.exe, then import both the atlas and .tpsheet file. Enjoy the MULTIPLE sprite!

If you got trouble with it (or want to improve it), you can rebuild the project solution in Source folder.

Thank https://github.com/danzel/SpriteSheetPacker for nice work, nice code to edit.
